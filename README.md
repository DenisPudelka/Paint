- **Resizable Brush and Shapes:** Tools for adjusting brush or shape sizes using a JSlider, with an additional feature to change sizes via Ctrl+Scroll.

## Academic Foundation
This application is inspired by a comprehensive Object-Oriented Programming course, which covered a wide array of topics including Java basics, data structures, control structures, and advanced concepts in object-oriented programming. The course was instrumental in developing a solid foundation in software engineering principles.

## Design Patterns
- **Command Design Pattern:** This pattern is exemplified in the undo and redo functionalities, demonstrating an effective use of design patterns in practical software development.
